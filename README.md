A Chrome extension that assigns hotkeys to play/pause, and to switch music (next and previous). If no player is currently opened, it fires up Spotify.

If there is more player tabs than one, it follows this order of priority: `Spotify > Deezer > SoundCloud > Youtube`

Works with:
* Spotify
* Deezer
* SoundCloud
* Youtube
